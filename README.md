# Statester

Statester is a Unity application that contains a survey and a simple game that emulates the character creation/progression of an RPG.

It was created to gather data for my university paper and I am begging you please help me i'lldoanything

Unfortunately, it is very limited and there is only one class in the game due to time constraints. 
Instructions to play are contained within the game.

The survey.txt file will be in the Data folder, I will be very grateful if you could send it to me once you are done playing, at tl.ouroborosinteractive@gmail.com or #venkaventego on Discord.
No personally identifying information is collected, only gameplay information.
